# Railway_Infrastructure
## Building a mini railroad map with locomotive movements between stations
### Table of contents
* Programming language: Java 
* Learned lesson: Use of proper OOP structure
* Purpose: Create a console visualised railroad map
### Features
* Create or automatically generate stations, locomotives, connections between stations and railroad cars(choose the type of railroad cars while creating them and fill particular information that is needed)
