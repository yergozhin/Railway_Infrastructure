# Train Simulation Project

Welcome to the Train Simulation Project repository! This project is designed to showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by simulating various aspects of train 
operations. It includes classes for stations, connections, locomotives, trainsets, and different types of railroad cars. Additionally, the project demonstrates functionalities of 
different railroad car types and includes a train scheduling and simulation system.

## Introduction
The Train Simulation Project is focused on simulating train operations using OOP principles. It aims to provide a comprehensive example of how different components of a train system can be represented and interact within a Java application.

### Creating Stations
- The project allows for the creation of train stations, with the ability to establish connections between them. These stations serve as the basis for creating a network of connections within the simulation.

### Train Components
- The simulation includes various components such as locomotives, trainsets, and different types of railroad cars. These elements are designed to mimic real-world train configurations, offering a diverse and realistic simulation experience.

### Functionality Examples
- The project showcases the functionalities of different railroad car types. From refrigerated cars with temperature control to passenger cars with seating adjustments and restaurant cars with menu options, the simulation provides a detailed representation of the capabilities of each component.

### Train Simulation
- The simulation allows for the creation of paths for locomotives to travel between stations. A queue system manages the scheduling of trainsets along their designated paths, providing a dynamic and interactive simulation of train operations.

### Generating Data
- For added convenience and scalability, the project includes functionalities to generate additional data. This includes the creation of multiple stations, trainsets, connections between stations, and paths for locomotives, contributing to a more extensive and diverse simulation.
